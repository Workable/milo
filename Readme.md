# ML I/O 
MLIO is a toolkit to help on implementation of I/O operations for machine learning projects. It is written for Python 3 
and it is split in two main modules:

 * [IO](docs/IO.md): The raw interface to serialize models and data to filesystem.
 * [Resources](docs/Resources.md): Registry of resource objects that are dynamically discovered and loaded from 
 a prioritized list of sources, called repositories.

## Installation

MLIO can be installed using `pip` either from public [pypi](https://test.pypi.org/project/pypi/) index 
or from git repository:

```sh
pip install mlio
```
